description: |
    The caster takes a hard, normally inedible object and bites and chews it; the success of the casting protects the caster from the usual effects of biting such things. The caster them spits the crumbled debris, which bursts into flames as it leaves the caster's mouth.

    Certain materials may have additional effects when used with this spell.

    Every failed casting of this spell causes 1d4 spellburn damage to the caster's mouth.
