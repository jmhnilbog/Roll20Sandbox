description: |
    The caster lulls a target into a deep, sound sleep. Creatures that do not slumber naturally, such as the undead, may be partially resistant or immune to this magic.

    This spell may cause two different kinds of sleep, **normal** or **supernatural**.

    Creatures in normal sleep for extended periods do not suffer from hunger or thirst while sleeping. They awaken with an appropriate level of hunger or thirst for the time spent sleeping, though they will have at least an hour to satisfy those needs before they become fatal.

    Supernaturally sleeping creatures do not suffer from hunger, thirst, aging, poisons, lack of air, or most similar concerns while sleeping. This state is similar to suspended animation.

    Usually, the caster must speak a condition related to the current circumstances as part of the casting, and must possess material components related to the condition. Should this condition become true, the subjects immediately awaken. *(Examples: A courtier casts this spell on a commonner and decides that only the kiss of nobility may break the spell. Intimate knowledge of the court counts as posessing a related material component. A burglar raiding a cathedral casts the spell on some guards and decides that churchbells will break the spell, knowing they shall be long gone by vespers.)*

    - ray of shimmering dust
    - swan's wings rise from the earth to enfold the target
